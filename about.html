            Utuscribe is an independent studio exploring how careful AI can support real people:
            authors, analysts, and service businesses that depend on trust and clarity.

            <h2>Where we are now</h2>
            <p>
              We are in the early build phase, working toward our first working prototypes of
              Responder AI and AirScribe. A small set of early adopters will be invited to test
              core workflows before anything is made broadly available.
            </p>
            <p>
              The focus is simple: practical tools that are fast, reliable, and honest about
              what they can and cannot do.
            </p>

            <h2>What we care about</h2>
            <ul class="page-list">
              <li>Respecting human judgment and keeping humans in the loop.</li>
              <li>Designing for privacy, security, and future compliance requirements from day one.</li>
              <li>Building systems that stay understandable, even as they become more capable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As Utuscribe grows, more details about the roadmap will be shared here ahead of
              larger announcements.
